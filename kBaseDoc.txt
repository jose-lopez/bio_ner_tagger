Defective mitogen-induced cellular cytotoxicity in myelodysplastic syndromes. Recovery after alpha-interferon administration. Peripheral blood mitogen - induced cellular cytotoxicity (MICC) and natural killer- cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) were assessed in 25 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Both MICC and NKCC were examined under the same experimental conditions using the 18 hr chromium release assay, except that cultures for MICC were stimulated in vitro by the addition of phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Patients' MICC was found significantly reduced, in relation to controls (p less than 0.001), but significantly higher than patients' NKCC (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, patients CD3+ cells and CD4+ cells, as well as the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, were significantly decreased (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.001, respectively), while CD8+ cells and CD16+ cells were within normal limits. No relationship was noted between patients' MICC and total lymphocyte count or any lymphocyte subpopulation. In eleven patients who were subsequently subjected to a-interferon (a-IFN) administration, MICC values were found within normal range one month after the cessation of alpha-IFN, while NKCC values were significantly increased (p less than 0.01), but they still remained below the lower limit of the control (p less than 0.001). Percentages of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells, as well as the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, did not change after alpha-IFN, but the absolute numbers of CD3+ cells and CD8+ cells were significantly reduced. A statistically significant rise was noted in CD16+ cells. Post- IFN rises in MICC did not correlate with lymphocyte subpopulations. The findings indicate that MDS patients display very low MICC, which can be restored by alpha-IFN administration. The cause of this disturbance and the mechanism of its restoration by alpha-IFN remain unclear. PUBMED_ID: 2064322

The control of many persistent viral infections by Ag-specific cytolytic CD8+ T cells requires a concurrent virus-specific CD4+ Th cell response. PUBMED_ID: 12963692

These results suggest that the loss of CD28 expression during differentiation of memory/effector CD8+ T cells represents a decisive step in establishing regulation of responding CD8+ T cells, increasing the dependence on CD4+ Th for proliferation after target recognition, and has implications for the treatment of viral disease with adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells.

PUBMED_ID: 14583496

NY-ESO-1-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were also able to recognize NY-ESO-1 expressing neuroblastoma cells. PUBMED_ID: 14583496

In addition, epitopes of NY-ESO-1 protein were also presented on MHC class II molecules to NY-ESO-1-specific CD4(+) T cells. PUBMED_ID: 15102697

RESULTS: A rare population of NY-ESO-1-specific T cells, which we named 19305DP, expressed cell surface CD4, CD8alpha, and CD8beta but not CD56 and recognized A*02+NY-ESO-1+ cancer cell lines in a CD4- and CD8-independent manner. PUBMED_ID: 30626427

Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were retrovirally transduced with 19305DP-derived TCR gene (19305DP-TCR) showed strong reactivity against A*02+NY-ESO-1+ cancer cells, whereas TCR genes from the conventional A*02-restricted NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ single-positive T-cell clones functioned only in CD8+ T cells.

Immune system and prognosis in colorectal cancer: a detailed immunohistochemical analysis. The efficacy of tumor cell-immune cell interactions depends on a number of factors, for example, the expression of HLA-I on tumor cells, the type of immune cell, the accessibility of tumor cells for immune cells and the expression of immunogenic epitopes. We assessed infiltration of CD4+, CD8+, CD56+ and CD57+ cells in the tumor epithelium, tumor stroma and advancing tumor margin of 93 colorectal carcinomas and correlated this to clinicopathological parameters, the expression of HLA-A and HLA-B/C on tumor cells, the presence of a basal membrane (BM)-like structure surrounding tumor nodules and the presence of microsatellite instability/mutator phenotype (absent MLH-1 expression). The median intraepithelial CD4+, CD8+, CD56+ and CD57+ cell infiltrations were 3, 23, 0 and 0 cells/mm(2) tumor, respectively. HLA-A/BC expression by tumor cells was normal in 28/43%, heterogeneous in 59/48% and absent in 13/9% of the cases. A BM-like structure surrounding the tumor nodules was absent, present and thick in 47, 38 and 15% of the cases. Six cases lost MLH1 expression. There was a positive correlation between leukocyte infiltration in the three compartments for CD4+, CD8+, CD56+ (partly) and CD57+ (all P<0.05) cell infiltration. Intraepithelial CD8+ cell infiltration inversely correlated with HLA-A (P=0.04) and HLA-B/C expression (P=0.04). Intraepithelial CD57+ cell infiltration inversely correlated with HLA-B/C expression (P=0.04). Moreover, intraepithelial infiltration of CD8+ and CD57+ cells was inversely correlated to the presence of a BM-like structure (P=0.003 and 0.04, respectively). Uni- and multivariate analyses showed that a lower tumor stage (P=0.004) and marked infiltration of CD8+ (P=0.04) and CD57+ cells (P=0.05) at the advancing tumor margin were independent prognostic factors for a longer disease-free survival. Loss of MLH1 expression was correlated with a significantly higher intraepithelial CD8+ and CD57+ cell infiltration. We conclude that infiltration of CD8+ and CD57+ cells are important prognostic factors in colorectal cancer. However, their interaction with tumor cells is inversely correlated to the presence of HLA-I on tumor cells and a thick BM-like structure around tumor islets. Our data indicate that NK cells might play an important role in the immune surveillance in colorectal cancer patients. PUBMED_ID: 14968119

METHODS: A*02-restricted NY-ESO-1-specific T-cell clones were established from peripheral blood of patients who had NY-ESO-1-expressing ovarian tumors. PUBMED_ID: 30626427

RESULTS: A rare population of NY-ESO-1-specific T cells, which we named 19305DP, expressed cell surface CD4, CD8alpha, and CD8beta but not CD56 and recognized A*02+NY-ESO-1+ cancer cell lines in a CD4- and CD8-independent manner. PUBMED_ID: 30626427

Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were retrovirally transduced with 19305DP-derived TCR gene (19305DP-TCR) showed strong reactivity against A*02+NY-ESO-1+ cancer cells, whereas TCR genes from the conventional A*02-restricted NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ single-positive T-cell clones functioned only in CD8+ T cells.

Both 19305DP-TCR gene-engineered CD4+ and CD8+ T cells eliminated A*02+NY-ESO-1+ tumor xenografts in NSG mice. PUBMED_ID: 30626427

CONCLUSION: Together, our results indicate that the naturally occurring 19305DP-TCR derived from CD4+CD8+ double-positive alphabeta T cells, is a promising therapeutic TCR gene for effective and safe adoptive T-cell therapy in A*02+ patients with NY-ESO-1-expressing tumor. PUBMED_ID: 30626427

Killing of human immunodeficiency virus-infected primary T-cell blasts by autologous natural killer cells is dependent on the ability of the virus to alter the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. In the current study, we evaluated whether the capacity of HIV to modulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules has an impact on the ability of autologous natural killer (NK) cells to kill the HIV-infected cells. Analysis of HIV-infected T-cell blasts revealed that the decrease in MHC class I molecules on the infected cell surface was selective. HLA-A and -B were decreased on cells infected with HIV strains that could decrease MHC class I molecules, whereas HLA-C and -E remained on the surface. Blocking the interaction between HLA-C and -E and their corresponding inhibitory receptors increased NK cell killing of T-cell blasts infected with HIV strains that reduced MHC class I molecules. Moreover, we demonstrate that NK cells lacking HLA-C and -E inhibitory receptors kill T-cell blasts infected with HIV strains that decrease MHC class I molecules. In contrast, NK cells are incapable of destroying T-cell blasts infected with HIV strains that were unable to reduce MHC class I molecules. These findings suggest that NK cells lacking inhibitory receptors to HLA-C and -E kill HIV-infected CD4+ T cells, and they indicate that the capacity of NK cells to destroy HIV-infected cells depends on the ability of the virus to modulate MHC class I molecules. PUBMED_ID: 15117765

Analysis of antigen-specific T-cell responses with synthetic peptides--what kind of peptide for which purpose? The analysis of T-cell responses to peptides has recently become a busy area of immunologic research. Peptides may be used as single stimulants, pools or libraries, or as part of peptide/major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) for direct T-cell receptor staining. For stimulating T cells, peptides must be bound to MHC molecules. In this study we have used 9- or 10-amino acid peptides, 15-amino acid peptides containing stimulating shorter sequences, and peptides with modified C-terminal function. On average 67% of the T cells from healthy cytomegalovirus-positive donors that bound a frequently used cytomegalovirus pp65/HLA-A*0201 tetramer were able to produce interferon-gamma on stimulation with the respective 9-amino acid peptide. Peptides of 15 amino acids length used at the same concentration (in microg/ml) stimulated CD8 T cells somewhat less efficiently (on average 77% of the frequencies induced with the respective shorter peptides). Modifications of 9-amino acid peptides such as addition of amino acids or functional groups often resulted in a decreased ability to stimulate. However, based on our own results, published data, and theoretic considerations, we conclude that sets of peptides of 15 amino acids length with 11 amino acids overlap represent a good compromise for stimulating both CD8 and CD4 T cells in a number of applications. These parameters may be modified subject to the purpose of a study. PUBMED_ID: 15172453

Classical and nonclassical class I major histocompatibility complex molecules exhibit subtle conformational differences that affect binding to CD8alphaalpha. PUBMED_ID: 10809759

The cell surface molecules CD4 and CD8 greatly enhance the sensitivity of T-cell antigen recognition, acting as \co-receptors\ by binding to the same major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules as the T-cell receptor (TCR). PUBMED_ID: 10809759

Here we use surface plasmon resonance to study the binding of CD8alphaalpha to class I MHC molecules. PUBMED_ID: 10809759

CD8alphaalpha bound the classical MHC molecules HLA-A*0201, -A*1101, -B*3501, and -C*0702 with dissociation constants (K(d)) of 90-220 microm, a range of affinities distinctly lower than that of TCR/peptide-MHC interaction. PUBMED_ID: 10809759

We suggest such affinities apply to most CD8alphaalpha/classical class I MHC interactions and may be optimal for T-cell recognition. PUBMED_ID: 10809759

Interestingly, CD8alphaalpha bound normally to the nonclassical MHC molecule HLA-G (K(d) approximately 150 microm), but only weakly to the natural killer cell receptor ligand HLA-E (K(d) >/= 1 mm). PUBMED_ID: 10809759

Taken together with crystallographic studies, these results indicate that subtle conformational changes in the solvent exposed alpha3 domain loop (residues 223-229) can account for the differential ability of both classical and nonclassical class I MHC molecules to bind CD8. PUBMED_ID: 10809759

As a result, we found that mdDCs loading HLA-A*0201-restricted HPV 11 E7 CTL epitope peptide could respond to the TLR agonists, especially LPS and PIC. This was characterized by an enhanced expression of CD40, CD80, CD86, CD83 and HLA-DR, and a high level of IL-12 production. TLR agonists, especially PIC, enhanced the ability of E7-loaded mdDCs to induce IFN-gamma-secretion CD4(+) naive T cells. Moreover, E7-loaded mdDCs exposed to TLR agonists augmented autologous T cell responses including effector cytokines production and specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. In addition, the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on mdDCs maturation could be partially restored by LPS, PIC or imiquimod. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TLR agonists promoted the maturation of E7-loaded mdDCs and their ability to induce T help type 1 polarization and augment E7-specific T cell responses. These data also indicated that TLR3/4 agonists might be effective adjuvants of mdDC-based vaccines against CA. PUBMED_ID: 19578865

Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were retrovirally transduced with 19305DP-derived TCR gene (19305DP-TCR) showed strong reactivity against A*02+NY-ESO-1+ cancer cells, whereas TCR genes from the conventional A*02-restricted NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ single-positive T-cell clones functioned only in CD8+ T cells.

A rare population of tumor antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ double-positive alphabeta T lymphocytes uniquely provide CD8-independent TCR genes for engineering therapeutic T cells. PUBMED_ID: 30626427

BACKGROUND: High-affinity tumor antigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) gene is required to engineer potent T cells for therapeutic treatment of cancer patients. PUBMED_ID: 30626427

However, discovery of suitable therapeutic TCR genes is hampered by the fact that naturally occurring tumor antigen-specific TCRs are generally of low-affinity, and artificial modification of TCRs can mediate cross-reactivity to other antigens expressed in normal tissues. PUBMED_ID: 30626427

METHODS: Conversion of chimerism in the presence of GVHD after CD4 donor lymphocyte infusion was observed in a patient, HLA 10/10 matched, but mismatched for HLA-DRB3 and HLA-DPB1 compared with the donor. PUBMED_ID: 28252558

CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the assumption that mismatches in HLA-DRB3, 4, and 5 are not of immunogenic significance after HLA 10/10 matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation, we show that in this matched setting not only mismatches in HLA-DPB1, but also mismatches in HLA-DRB3 may induce a polyclonal allo-immune response associated with conversion of chimerism and severe GVHD.

Immunodominant tuberculosis CD8 antigens preferentially restricted by HLA-B. CD8(+) T cells are essential for host defense to intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), Salmonella species, and Listeria monocytogenes, yet the repertoire and dominance pattern of human CD8 antigens for these pathogens remains poorly characterized. Tuberculosis (TB), the disease caused by Mtb infection, remains one of the leading causes of infectious morbidity and mortality worldwide and is the most frequent opportunistic infection in individuals with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, we undertook this study to define immunodominant CD8 Mtb antigens. First, using IFN-gamma ELISPOT and synthetic peptide arrays as a source of antigen, we measured ex vivo frequencies of CD8(+) T cells recognizing known immunodominant CD4(+) T cell antigens in persons with latent tuberculosis infection. In addition, limiting dilution was used to generate panels of Mtb-specific T cell clones. Using the peptide arrays, we identified the antigenic specificity of the majority of T cell clones, defining several new epitopes. In all cases, peptide representing the minimal epitope bound to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricting allele with high affinity, and in all but one case the restricting allele was an HLA-B allele. Furthermore, individuals from whom the T cell clone was isolated harbored high ex vivo frequency CD8(+) T cell responses specific for the epitope, and in individuals tested, the epitope represented the single immunodominant response within the CD8 antigen. We conclude that Mtb-specific CD8(+) T cells are found in high frequency in infected individuals and are restricted predominantly by HLA-B alleles, and that synthetic peptide arrays can be used to define epitope specificities without prior bias as to MHC binding affinity. These findings provide an improved understanding of immunodominance in humans and may contribute to a development of an effective TB vaccine and improved immunodiagnostics. PUBMED_ID: 17892322

Interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha promote the ability of human placenta-derived mesenchymal stromal cells to express programmed death ligand-2 and induce the differentiation of CD4(+)interleukin-10(+) and CD8(+)interleukin-10(+)Treg subsets. PUBMED_ID: 26432559

Therefore, this work investigated the effects of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha on the ability of human placenta-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hPMSCs) on inducing the differentiation of CD4(+)interleukin (IL)-10(+)and CD8(+)IL-10(+)Treg subsets. PUBMED_ID: 26432559

Furthermore, the percentages of CD4(+)IL-10(+) and CD8(+)IL-10(+)T cells also sharply declined under the trans-well system, whereas the percentages as well as the expression of PDL2 in hPMSCs oppositely raised after hPMSCs pre-stimulated by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. PUBMED_ID: 26432559

CONCLUSIONS: IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha could promote the ability of hPMSCs in inducing the differentiation of CD4(+)IL-10(+)and CD8(+)IL-10(+)Treg subsets and enhance the expression of PDL2 in hPMSCs. PUBMED_ID: 26432559

Graft-vs-Host Disease-Induced Hyperthyroidism in a Recipient of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Case Report. BACKGROUND: Hyperthyroidism after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is rare, and only a few cases have been reported. What is more important, the fundamental mechanisms of hyperthyroidism after HSCT remained unclear. CASE: A 28-year-old man received an HLA haploidentical related-donor HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia and developed hyperthyroidism 31 months after HSCT. He presented with periodic paralysis as the initial symptom, his serum levels of free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and anti-thyroid autoantibodies increased, and thyroid-stimulating hormone level decreased. As a result, he was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Although systemic symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) were absent, thyroid histopathologic examination revealed thyroid follicular destruction and infiltrations of lymphocytes, which mainly consisted of CD20+ B lymphocytes and CD4+ and CD3+ T lymphocytes by immunohistochemistry. These were in accordance with the pathologic features of GVHD. The symptom of periodic paralysis resolved after treatment with prednisolone and methimazole for 1 month. The treatments lasted for 4 months, and the plasma levels of fT3, fT4, TSH, and anti-thyroid peroxidase normalized. He did not relapse after drug withdrawal with observation for 24 months to date. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the present case was the first to be confirmed with thyroid-specific GVHD-induced hyperthyroidism after allogeneic HSCT. PUBMED_ID: 32694060

Graft-vs-Host Disease-Induced Hyperthyroidism in a Recipient of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Case Report. BACKGROUND: Hyperthyroidism after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is rare, and only a few cases have been reported. What is more important, the fundamental mechanisms of hyperthyroidism after HSCT remained unclear. CASE: A 28-year-old man received an HLA haploidentical related-donor HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia and developed hyperthyroidism 31 months after HSCT. He presented with periodic paralysis as the initial symptom, his serum levels of free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and anti-thyroid autoantibodies increased, and thyroid-stimulating hormone level decreased. As a result, he was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Although systemic symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) were absent, thyroid histopathologic examination revealed thyroid follicular destruction and infiltrations of lymphocytes, which mainly consisted of CD20+ B lymphocytes and CD4+ and CD3+ T lymphocytes by immunohistochemistry.

The association between myositis-specific autoantibodies and muscle pathologies in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate specific muscle pathologies of different kinds of myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) patients. METHODS: One hundred eleven Chinese patients from Xiangya Hospital, Central South University diagnosed with IIMs according to European Neuromuscular Centre (ENMC) criteria were included. Clinical manifestation, myositis-specific autoantibodies, and histologic findings were evaluated to explore the pattern of necrosis, regeneration, and perifascicular atrophy, inflammatory cells in IIM patients with different MSAs. RESULTS: Anti-SRP group has the lowest muscle strength scores, the highest creatine kinase levels, the most severe degree of necrosis and regeneration (1.90[0.80-3.95], 1.00[0.30-1.71]), and the lowest positive rate of MHC-I staining (35.71%). The anti-MDA5 group demonstrates the mildest pathological changes, with the fewest necrotic and regenerated muscle fibers (0.00[0.00-0.50], 0.00[0.00-0.00]), and the fewest inflammatory cell infiltration, and the highest muscle strength scores. The anti-NXP2 group has the most frequent inflammatory infiltrates, especially CD4+ T cells (31.14[15.00-39.00]). The patients with anti-NXP2 and the anti-TIF1gamma antibodies show higher frequency of punched-out fibers (1.50[0.00-3.70], 0.00[0.00-1.00]) and perifascicular atrophy (71.43%, 55.56%). As for anti-synthetase antibodies (ASAs), the anti-Jo-1 group shows the most frequent rate of perifascicular necrosis (60%), while other ASA groups do not show perifascicular necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the MSAs, the anti-SRP antibody leads to the most severe muscle involvement, while the anti-MAD5 antibody the mildest. The anti-NXP2 and anti-TIF1gamma groups have the most typical \DM\ pathology. Key Points   Anti-SRP group shows severe muscle pathology while anti-MDA5 group shows the mildest.   Anti-NXP2 group has the most frequent inflammatory infiltrates. Pouch-out fibers and perifascicular atrophy are more prevalent in anti-NXP2 and anti-TIF1gamma groups.

Immunophenotyping of Peripheral Blood, Lymph Node, and Bone Marrow T Lymphocytes During Canine Leishmaniosis and the Impact of Antileishmanial Chemotherapy. Dogs are a major reservoir of Leishmania infantum, etiological agent of canine leishmaniosis (CanL) a zoonotic visceral disease of worldwide concern. Therapeutic protocols based on antileishmanial drugs are commonly used to treat sick dogs and improve their clinical condition. To better understand the impact of Leishmania infection and antileishmanial drugs on the dog's immune response, this study investigates the profile of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets in peripheral blood, lymph node, and bone marrow of sick dogs and after two different CanL treatments. Two CanL groups of six dogs each were treated with either miltefosine or meglumine antimoniate combined with allopurinol. Another group of 10 clinically healthy dogs was used as control. Upon diagnosis and during the following 3 months of treatment, peripheral blood, popliteal lymph node, and bone marrow mononuclear cells were collected, labeled for surface markers CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, and intracellular nuclear factor FoxP3, and T lymphocyte subpopulations were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. CanL dogs presented an overall increased frequency of CD8+ and CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells in all tissues and a decreased frequency of CD4+ T cells in the blood. Furthermore, there was a higher frequency of CD8+ T cells expressing CD25+FoxP3+ in the blood and bone marrow. During treatment, these subsets recovered to levels similar to those of healthy dogs. Nevertheless, antileishmanial therapy caused an increase of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells in all tissues, associated with the decrease of CD8+CD25-FoxP3- T cell percentages. These findings may support previous studies that indicate that L. infantum manipulates the dog's immune system to avoid the development of a protective response, ensuring the parasite's survival and the conditions that allow the completion of Leishmania life cycle. Both treatments used appear to have an effect on the dog's immune response, proving to be effective in promoting the normalization of T cell subsets. PUBMED_ID: 32760744

Dose escalation phase 1 study of radiotherapy in combination with anti-cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma. BACKGROUND: A synergy between radiotherapy and anti-cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody has been demonstrated preclinically. The Mel-Ipi-Rx phase 1 study aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety profile of radiotherapy combined with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 3+3 dose escalation design was used with 9, 15, 18 and 24 Gy dose of radiotherapy at week 4 combined with 10 mg/kg ipilimumab every 3 weeks for four doses. Patients with evidence of clinical benefit at week 12 were eligible for maintenance with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks starting at week 24 until severe toxicity or disease progression. The database lock occurred on April 30, 2019. Tumor growth rate of irradiated lesions and non-irradiated lesions were analyzed to assess the systemic immunologic antitumor response. Blood immune monitoring was performed before and during treatment to determine if radiotherapy could modify ipilimumab pharmacodynamics. RESULTS: 19 patients received ipilimumab between August 2011 and July 2015. Nine patients received the four doses of ipilimumab. All patients received the combined radiotherapy. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in nine patients, the most common being colitis and hepatitis. No drug-related death occurred. Dose limiting toxicity occurred in two of six patients in the cohort receiving 15 Gy. The MTD was 9 Gy. Two patients had complete response, three had partial response response and seven had stable disease, giving an objective response rate of 31% and a clinical benefit rate of 75% at week 24. The median duration of follow-up was 5.8 years (Q1=4.5; Q3=6.8). The median overall survival (95% CI) was estimated at 0.9 years (0.5-2). The median progression-free survival (PFS) (95% CI) was 0.4 (0.2-1.4). Radiotherapy combined with ipilimumab was associated with increased CD4+ and CD8+ICOS+ T cells. Increased CD8+ was significantly associated with PFS. CONCLUSION: When combined with ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg, the MTD of radiotherapy was 9 Gy. This combination of ipilimumab and radiotherapy appears to be associated with antitumor activity. Increased CD8+ was significantly associated with PFS. Thus, immune biomarkers may be useful for early response evaluation. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01557114. PUBMED_ID: 32819972

Sentences from abstracts:
------------------------

Mechanistically, miR-181b inhibited the expression of the target gene importin-alpha3, an effect that reduced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation specifically in the vascular endothelium of lesions, whereas surprisingly leukocyte NF-kappaB signaling was unaffected despite a 7-fold overexpression of miR-181b. PUBMED_ID: 24084690

Our findings uncover that NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in leukocytes does not involve importin-alpha3, but rather importin-alpha5, which miR-181b does not target, highlighting that inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling in the endothelium is sufficient to mediate miR-181b's protective effects.

Sentences from abstracts:
------------------------

Loss of intraepidermal nerve fiber density during SIV peripheral neuropathy is mediated by monocyte activation and elevated monocyte chemotactic proteins. BACKGROUND: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) continues to be a major complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection despite successful anti-retroviral therapy. Human HIV-PN can be recapitulated in a CD8-depleted, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaque animal model, characterized by a loss of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) and damage to the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Increased monocyte traffic to the DRG has previously been associated with severe DRG pathology, as well as a loss in IENFD. Here, we sought to characterize the molecular signals associated with monocyte activation and trafficking to the DRGs. METHODS: Eleven SIV-infected CD8-depleted rhesus macaques were compared to four uninfected control animals. sCD14, sCD163, sCD137, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) were measured in plasma and the latter three proteins were also quantified in DRG tissue lysates. All SIV-infected animals received serial skin biopsies to measure IENFD loss as well as BrdU inoculations to measure monocyte turnover during the course of infection. The number of BrdU+ and CD14+ CD16+ peripheral blood monocytes was determined by flow cytometry. The number of MAC387+, CCR2+, CCR5+, and CD137+ cells in DRG tissue was quantified by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: sCD14, sCD163, MCP-1, and sCD137 increased significantly in plasma from pre-infection to necropsy. Plasma sCD163 and RANTES inversely correlated with IENFD. Additionally, sCD137 in DRG tissue lysate was elevated with severe DRG pathology and associated with the recruitment of MAC387+ cells to DRG. Elevated numbers of CCR5+ and CCR2+ satellite cells in the DRG were found, suggesting a chemotactic role of their ligands, RANTES, and MCP-1 in recruiting monocytes to the tissue. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized the role of systemic (plasma) and tissue-specific (DRG) monocyte activation and associated cytokines in the pathogenesis of SIV-PN. We identified sCD163 and RANTES as potential biomarkers for HIV-PN, as these were associated with a loss of IENFD. Additionally, we identified CD137 signaling to play a role in MAC387+ cell traffic to DRG and possibly contribute to severe pathology. These studies highlight the role of monocyte activation and traffic in the pathogenesis of SIV-PN, while identifying specific signaling proteins for future pharmacological blockade.

CD11c(+)  CD103(+) cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected C57BL/6 but not of BALB/c mice induce a high frequency of interferon-gamma- or interleukin-17-producing CD4(+) cells. The magnitude of the cellular adaptive immune response is critical for the control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in the chronic phase. In addition, the genetic background is equally important for resistance or susceptibility to tuberculosis. In this study, we addressed whether lung populations of dendritic cells, obtained from genetically different hosts, would play a role in the magnitude and function of CD4(+) populations generated after M. tuberculosis infection. Thirty days post-infection, C57BL/6 mice, which generate a stronger interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-mediated immune response than BALB/c mice, exhibited a higher number and frequency of lung CD11c(+)  CD11b(-)  CD103(+) cells compared with BALB/c mice, which exhibited a high frequency of lung CD11c(+)  CD11b(+)  CD103(-) cells. CD11c(+)  CD11b(-)  CD103(+) cells, purified from lungs of infected C57BL/6 mice, but not from infected BALB/c mice, induced a higher frequency of IFN-gamma-producing or interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing CD4(+) cells. Moreover, CD4(+) cells also arrive at the lung of C57BL/6 mice faster than in BALB/c mice. This pattern of immune response seems to be associated with higher gene expression for CCL4, CCL19, CCL20 and CCR5 in the lungs of infected C57BL/6 mice compared with infected BALB/c mice. The results described here show that the magnitude of IFN-gamma-producing or IL-17-producing CD4(+) cells is dependent on CD11c(+)  CD11b(-)  CD103(+) cells, and this pattern of immune response is directly associated with the host genetic background. Therefore, differences in the genetic background contribute to the identification of immunological biomarkers that can be used to design human assays to predict progression of M. tuberculosis infection.

Sentences from abstracts:
------------------------

CXCR4 is aberrantly expressed in immune-mediated diseases and its regulation by nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in cancer models is well documented. PUBMED_ID: 25647836

We also report that NF-kappaB occupancy at the CXCR4 promoter is enhanced in BM-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells of AA mice. PUBMED_ID: 25647836

Moreover, inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling in AA mice using Bay11 or dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin, or transferring p50(-/-) splenocytes, decreased CXCR4 expression on CD8(+) T cells, significantly reduced BM infiltration of T cells, and strongly attenuated disease symptoms. PUBMED_ID: 25647836

Overall, we demonstrate that CXCR4 mediates migration of pathogenic T cells to the BM in AA mice, and inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling may represent a novel therapeutic approach to treating AA. PUBMED_ID: 25647836

Sentences from abstracts:
------------------------

Characterization of a single peptide derived from cytochrome P450 1B1 that elicits spontaneous human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A1 as well as HLA-B35 restricted CD8 T-cell responses in cancer patients. Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is widely expressed in human malignancies, but silent in most normal tissues. Importantly, the protein is believed to play an important role in the survival and growth of cancer cells in a stressed environment, e.g., as a result of hypoxia or chemotherapy. Thus, targeting of CYP1B1 represents a potentially successful strategy in the treatment of metastatic cancer, e.g., by therapeutic vaccination. Herein, we describe the characterization of a novel peptide from the CYP1B1 protein (CYP240), which is spontaneously recognized by CD8 T cells in cancer patients. Interestingly, the peptide binds to both human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A1 and HLA-B35. Hence, peripheral blood lymphocytes from a total of 49 cancer patients (25 melanoma, 13 RCC, and 11 breast cancer; 41 HLA-A1 positive, 8 HLA-B35 positive) were analyzed for reactivity taking advantage of the EliSpot assay. Rare but strong responses were detected in HLA-A1-positive patients, and more frequent responses were detected in HLA-B35-positive patients. No reactivity against the peptide could be detected in healthy donors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that peptide-specific T cells were able to lyze target cells presenting the peptide on the surface. The characterized CYP240 peptide presented herein opens the avenue for more broader recruitment of patients in vaccination trials targeting CYB1B1. PUBMED_ID: 18486761

METHODS: Sixteen HRPC patients with positive HLA-A201 were enrolled and their monocytes isolated and induced into dendritic cells with the combination of rhGM-CSF and rhIL4. The patients were inoculated subcutaneously near the inguinal region with auto-DCs pulsed with peptides PSA (KLQCVDLHV) , PSMA (ALDVYNGL L) and PAP (LLHETDSAV) every 2 weeks for 4 times, and the immunological and clinical responses were examined within 1 -2 weeks after the final vaccination. RESULTS: Vaccination of dendritic cells was well tolerated and no toxicity was observed. The cytokine levels in the serum such as IL-2, IL-12 and IFN-gamma were significantly increased after the vaccination (P < 0.01). The delayed type hyper- sensitivity (DTH) test was positive in 4 of the patients (4/11), the percentage of antigen-special IFN-gamma+ CD8+ T increased in 5 (5/11), the level of the tumor marker PSA decreased in 6 (6/16) , hydrops abdominis reduced in 1 (1/16), and the size of the cervical lymph node lessened in 1 (1/16).

RESULTS: Using this kit, islet autoreactive CD8(+) T-cells recognizing insulin B(10-18), IA-2(797-805), and IGRP(265-273) were shown to be frequently detectable in recent-onset diabetic patients but rarely in healthy control subjects; PPI(15-24) proved to be the most sensitive epitope.

Sentences from abstracts:
------------------------

CD8+ T cell epitope-flanking mutations disrupt proteasomal processing of HIV-1 Nef. CTL play a critical role in the control of HIV and SIV. However, intrinsic genetic instability enables these immunodeficiency viruses to evade detection by CTL through mutation of targeted antigenic sites. These mutations can impair binding of viral epitopes to the presenting MHC class I molecule or disrupt TCR-mediated recognition. In certain regions of the virus, functional constraints are likely to limit the capacity for variation within epitopes. Mutations elsewhere in the protein, however, might still enable immune escape through effects on Ag processing. In this study, we describe the coincident emergence of three mutations in a highly conserved region of Nef during primary HIV-1 infection. These mutations (R69K, A81G, and H87R) flank the HLA B*35-restricted VY8 epitope and persisted to fixation as the early CTL response to this Ag waned. The variant form of Nef showed a reduced capacity to activate VY8-specific CTL, although protein stability and expression levels were unchanged. This effect was associated with altered processing by the proteasome that caused partial destruction of the VY8 epitope. Our data demonstrate that a variant HIV genotype can significantly impair proteasomal epitope processing and substantiate the concept of immune evasion through diminished Ag generation. These observations also indicate that the scale of viral escape may be significantly underestimated if only intraepitope variation is evaluated. PUBMED_ID: 16177107
